# Testing


# happy path

1. Multiplication
- expect function prompt to take two inputs
- expect function prompt to only accept numbers
- expect function to multiply the two inputs
- expect function to return the product of the two numbers


# unhappy path

- function takes more than two inputs
- function will not take any inputs
- function will accept a string instead of integers/floats
- function does not multiply the product
- function does not return the product
- function gives error/undefined message when it is run

2. concatOdds

# happy path
- expect function to iterate through both arrays
- expect function to able to identify odd numbers
- expect function to filter out odd numbers and return them
- expect function to prompt users for a string of numbers
- expect function to convert string into integers
- expect function to alert user when unacceptable inputs are given with message,"Inputs must be numbers"
- if multiples of the same number are input, the function should only return it once


# unhappy path
- function does not store input for string of numbers entered
- function does not read the numbers in the arrays
- function does not filter odd numbers
- function does not prompt user for input
- function displays multiples instances of the same number when input

3. Shopping Cart

# happy path

- function will not give option to checkout as guest
- function will not alow user to register
- function will not allow user to sign-in
